Project- Graduate Analysis and Admission Prediction Machine Learning Model

•	Developed a predictive model for graduate admissions using logistic regression, SVM, random forest, decision tree, and KNN, achieving an accuracy of X%.  
•	Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed data, including handling missing values and feature engineering.  
•	Implemented and evaluated models with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC; optimized models with feature selection and hyper parameter tuning.
